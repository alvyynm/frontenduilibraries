# Frontend UI Libraries

A multituide of frontend UI libraries exist to make development easier and faster. This is my go-to list of UI libraries that I use (or plan to) use in projects. 

## Fully-fledged component libraries

- [MUI](https://mui.com/)
- [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/)
- [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/)
- [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/)
- [RadixUI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) - open-source UI component library
- [TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com/) - made by the guys at TailwindCSS
- [Primereact](https://primereact.org/)
- [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/) - also created by TailwindCSS
- [xstyled](https://xstyled.dev/) - A CSS-in-JS framework built for React with props based utilities like display, fontSize or rotate.
- [GeistUI](https://geist-ui.dev/en-us)
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)

## Own your (their?) code

- [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Based on TailwindCSS, but is not a dependency

## Dedicated UI Libraries 

- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - Performant, flexible and extensible forms with easy-to-use validation. Works with React Web and Native.
- [nivo.rocks](https://nivo.rocks/) -  provides a rich set of dataviz components, built on top of D3 and React.
- [TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table/v8) - Headless UI for building tables & datagrids
- [Formik](https://formik.org/) - creating forms in React
- [Final Form](https://final-form.org/) - another form library

### How to select a component library (according to this [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1542546932840534016?t=Pf8taffcV76eQE99mQ2qyw&s=03))
